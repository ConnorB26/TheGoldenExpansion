# The Golden Expansion - Minecraft Mod

This project introduces a gold-centric theme to the beloved game, Minecraft. The aim of "The Golden Expansion" mod is to diversify the in-game experience by adding golden versions of pre-existing items and plants, as well as an entirely new dimension complete with golden grass, trees, and a mesmerizing golden sky.

My intention behind creating this mod was twofold: first, to bring an imaginative twist to the game by emphasizing a universal appreciation for gold, and second, to delve deep into the world of game modding, a territory I had never ventured into before.

During the development process, I acquired knowledge and experience in:
* Java
* Minecraft modding principles
* Forge Mod Development Kit
* Navigating and adapting a comprehensive pre-existing codebase

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

Working on this mod presented its fair share of challenges. Given that this was my maiden venture into modding a game, understanding the intricacies of Minecraft's exhaustive codebase was an uphill task.

One of the main issues I faced was integrating the new items and ensuring their compatibility with the existing game mechanics. Additionally, creating a balanced gameplay experience that didn't tip the scales too heavily in favor of the golden items was critical.

Forge Mod Development Kit, while a powerful tool, had its learning curve. Ensuring that the mod was stable, especially when players transitioned to the golden dimension, required several iterations and testing phases. However, thanks to the extensive amount of material available online about Forge, along with a very active modding community, help was never too far away.
